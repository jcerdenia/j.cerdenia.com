2024 was the year I began calling myself a generalist after I was invited to speak before an audience of Python developers. I was asked for a bio; I have written many bios over the years for myself as a composer but I had never written one for tech. What to put in it? As a tech professional with a strange background I'm not as pedigreed or credentialed as my more specialized colleagues, and on that score I know I can't compete. What I do have is rat-like adaptability and a lack of apologies when it comes to leaning into whatever catches my interest.

In 2025 I intend to lean harder into generalism and use it as the springboard from which to launch my future career. I have allowed myself to drift in a direction by which I don't feel fulfilled; this is the year for decisive steps to get myself on the right course towards a career that makes fuller use of my unique abilities and gets me in closer proximity to the people I want to be working with.
