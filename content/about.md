J. C. is Joshua Cerdenia, who lives a double life as a [composer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhaNa_622Wc) (currently on hiatus) and software engineer. In my best moments, I'm neither of these.

See [what I'm doing now](/now).

## Mailing List

I'm experimenting with a private [mailing list](http://tinyletter.com/jcerdenia) to share sporadic updates on life and music on a personal scale. Join to make contact and exchange thoughts.
