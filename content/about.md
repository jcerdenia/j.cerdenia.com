J. C. is Joshua Cerdenia, who lives a double life as a composer (currently on hiatus) and software engineer. In my best moments, I'm neither of these.

<!-- My music can be found at [cerdenia.com](https://cerdenia.com), and a smattering of code I've written in my spare time on [my GitHub](https://github.com/joshuacerdenia). -->

See [what I'm doing now](/now).

## Mailing List

I'm experimenting with a private [mailing list](http://tinyletter.com/jcerdenia) to share sporadic updates on life and music on a personal scale. Join to make contact and exchange thoughts.
