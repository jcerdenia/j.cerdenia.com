J. C. is Josh Cerdenia. I'm a [composer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnmJFpS1x34) and software engineer.

I graduated from Juilliard in 2016 and began my working life as a musician in NYC. Somewhere along the way, I ventured into tech. I've always been a [generalist](/gpt-convos/1) and was never satisfied doing only one thing for very long. Currently I'm based in Manila and developing one of the leading consumer finance apps in the Philippines.

Musically I'm a student of the western classical tradition and am especially fond of the 20th-century American symphonists, which I think is obvious in [my work](https://cerdenia.com). Lately I've been primarily interested in musical theatre.

As a programmer I have experience across various platforms: web, backend, and mobile. I'm still trying to find my "tech voice" and simply lean hard into whatever holds my interest. Right now I'm [riding the AI train](/ai-accelerator).

Outside the workplace, I'm devoted to birding and esoteric pursuits.

# Contact

I'm all about cross-disciplinary collaboration, not to mention secondary income streams. Please [email me](mailto:joshua@cerdenia.com) if you'd like to work together.
