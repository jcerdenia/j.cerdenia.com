J. C. is Josh Cerdenia. I'm a [composer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnmJFpS1x34) and software engineer.

Born and raised in the Philippines, I graduated from Juilliard in 2016 and began my working life as a musician in NYC. Somewhere along the way, I got sidetracked into tech. I've always had a [generalist spirit](/chatgpt-conversations/1) and was never satisfied doing only one thing for very long. Currently I'm based in Manila and developing one of the country's top consumer finance apps.

Musically I'm a student of the western classical tradition and am especially fond of the 20th-century American symphonists, which I think is obvious in my work. Lately I've been primarily interested in musical theatre.

As for coding, I spend most of my time with Python and JavaScript frameworks. As a relative newcomer I'm still trying to find my "tech voice" and simply lean hard into whatever holds my interest. Right now I seem to be on the AI train.

Outside the workplace, I'm devoted to birding and esoteric pursuits.
