# 10/23–10/29

Arrived back at MNL late at night on the 23rd after a month in America. Early next morning, I was roused by the harsh, grating call outside my window of what I would later identify as the brown shrike, a winter visitor to these parts. Sleek and handsome, but apparently a "butcher bird." Immediately went out and began the week's birding.

My neighborhood east of the capital region is home to dozens of species due to considerable undeveloped wetland. Between the time I started birding in July and 10/23 I identified 12 species with certainty: Eurasian tree sparrow, yellow-vented bulbul, olive-backed sunbird, zebra dove, Philippine pied fantail, black-naped oriole, rock pigeon, golden-bellied gerygone, Java sparrow, large-billed crow, white-breasted waterhen, and crested myna (see also: [my running life list](/birding-life-list)). Most of these are common urban birds likely to be encountered as soon as one ventures out the door; some are not that common but can be expected to be seen with regularity. The golden-bellied gerygone is a particularly interesting case because its song is ubiquitous, but the bird itself is not such a common sight due to its small size.

It seems the experience I gained from all the birding I did in America paid off. Between 10/24 and today, 10/29, I ascertained 13 more species: brown shrike, white-breasted woodswallow, spotted dove, white-browed crake, common moorhen, coppersmith barbet, cattle egret, gray heron, purple heron, whiskered tern, red-keeled flowerpecker, scaly-breasted munia, and gray-rumped (or glossy) swiftlet. To these I might add a few more species that I believe I'm reasonably correct about, but do not claim certainty: barred rail, Arctic warbler, house swallow, barn swallow. In time I hope to be certain about them. And there are even more species I've sighted that I have not yet come close to identifying.

Of the 25 species listed above, my favorites are the yellow-vented bulbul, Philippine pied fantail, and coppersmith barbet. The bulbuls are abundant but always elegant and beautiful; one can never get tired of seeing them. The pied fantails, endemic to these islands, are feisty little birds with gorgeous tails despite their otherwise unremarkable coloration. The colorful barbet is the most visually striking bird I've yet seen in these parts. I have only seen them on two occasions in the same tree; I hope there are more of them.

The whole week I birded only my neighborhood wetland, except for this afternoon, which I spent at Heritage Memorial Park in Taguig. There, I met the president and some members of the Wild Bird Club of the Philippines in a chance encounter. I saw the usual urban birds (tree sparrows, pied fantails, swiftlets) and a few waterbirds (waterhens, moorhens, egrets) but no new species.

# 10/30–11/05

The first morning of the week saw the newest addition to my running list of local species: a lone Philippine pygmy woodpecker, which I spotted in the same tree that I saw the barbets last week. I greatly enjoyed seeing different American woodpeckers last month see my – as of now quite modest – [life list](/birding-life-list)); so I'm glad that my own neck of the woods has its own species of woodpecker. Another addition early in the week was the little egret, distinguished from the cattle egret by its more slender build and dark-colored bill. 

Last Sunday morning, 10/29, a fellow birder found me and told me about some black-winged stilts that are wintering in the area. Wednesday morning, 10/31, I saw a small flock of them in flight over the neighborhood pond before landing and disappearing quickly into the surrounding vegetation. It was very fleeting, but they were very distinctive: long dark bills, orange legs trailing behind in flight. That same afternoon, 10/31, I returned to Heritage Memorial Park and sighted a couple of (what I reasonably thought were) cinnamon bitterns around the lake. Apart from that, the suite of birds is basically the same as in my neighborhood. 

Next day, the black-winged stilts were still there; I entered a construction site jutting out into the pond to get a better view. Other familiar sights were moorhens, gray and purple herons, egrets, terns, and swiftlets and/or swallows (any of which I have yet to identify with certainty). Also saw the coppersmith barbets again (8 of them) in their favorite tree; they seem to perch there only a little while, possibly only once every morning, before flying off together into the trees off the road.

Saturday morning, 11/04, I went on a guided bird walk with the Wild Bird Club around the University of the Philippines, a popular and accessible birding spot in Metro Manila. Crested mynas and black-naped orioles were abundant. Also saw three new species: long-tailed shrike (a local resident, even more handsome than the migrant brown shrike), pied triller, and, with some reservation because it was small and hard to see, pygmy flowerpecker. Happy to say I am now a member of the Wild Bird Club, which should lead to some interesting birding trips in the future.

Finally, this morning, 11/05, I spotted what I thought were common sandpipers in the nearby marshes. Also saw a medium-sized brownish bird flitting around some tall grass; my first guess was some kind of grassbird, but I could not come to a confident answer; hope I see it again. In addition, it bears mentioning another highlight throughout the week, which was seeing more of the red-keeled flowerpecker around my neighborhood; a tiny but visually stunning species.

# 11/06–11/12

I continue to be surprised by the diversity of wild birds around my neighborhood wetland; though the rate of my identifying new species has slowed down since the last two weeks, I still never know what I might run into. Early in the week, on 11/06, I saw a small heron whose red-brownish head was poking out of some tall grass. Its head and neck was somewhat streaked, and it had a distinctive black-tipped bill. Several seconds after I spotted it, it flew out of its position and disappeared; in flight, its wings were all-white. I identified as a Javan pond-heron, a fairly common resident species according to my field guide.

Later that same day, while I was working at home, an unfamiliar bird perched on a telephone wire right outside my window. At first I thought I was finally looking at a kingfisher (which I had been wanting to find for some time); it had an overall blue-greenish color but its bill was noticeably sleeker and more pointed. I identified it as a blue-tailed bee-eater, yet another fairly common and widespread resident. I hope I see it again.

The next few days I expected not much, but as I was on my walk one afternoon a swallow glided overhead, from which I was able to clearly make out its deeply forked tail, indicating a barn swallow. Later, I was able to tell it apart from the Pacific swallow , another locally common swallow species. A point of confusion: my field guide, _Birds of the Philippines_ from Lynx and BirdLife International indicates House Swallow (_Hirundo javanica_) instead of Pacific Swallow (_Hirundo tahitica_). According to the taxonomic note on this species: "Previously treated as conspecific with extralimital Tahiti Swallow _H. tahitica_ ... under name Pacific Swallow." Tentatively, I stick to the (seemingly) more locally common designation of Pacific Swallow, but they are the same bird.

Friday morning, 11/10, I spent the better part of an hour following an egret around as it waded slowly across the pond and taking many (poor) pictures through my binocular; after consulting my field guides (here my North American field guides proved useful outside their jurisdiction; I have the National Geographic 7th ed. and _Sibley Birds East_) as well as other resources online, I became confident that it was a great egret. And finally, Sunday morning, 11/12, I saw for the first time a common kingfisher, which I was just able to make out in the distance.

# 11/13–11/14

Perhaps it is better to do these entries daily, or almost daily, rather than weekly so that I don't forget details. I don't anticipate identifying new species at the same rate as I did in the preceding weeks; but birds do not become less interesting just because I've seen them before. For example, yesterday morning, 11/13, I spotted a Philippine pygmy woodpecker in a different tree from the one in which I usually see them. While they are not abundant, they might be more common in this area than I thought.

This morning, 11/14, I received a spectacular lesson from the egrets in telling different species apart; it is really much easier when you are able to see and compare all of them at once. There was a great egret, in typical great egret fashion as I've come to know, wading slowly across the water; its very long and slender neck occasionally stretched out. Meanwhile, I spent a good amount of time observing two intermediate egrets – which I identified by their more rounded heads (more rounded than the great egret's), slightly stocky frames, and conspicuously black-tipped bills – chasing (?) each other and flitting around the pond; they are spectacular fliers, and one could never tire of watching them. From time to time, and for good measure, a little egret would show up, easily distinguished by its small size and black bill. Also present were gray herons, purple herons, whiskered terns, common moorhens, and black-winged stilts. All in all they make for a dazzling sight that makes me wonder what pathetic stupor I'd been in all this time not to notice that this place is absolutely teeming with life.

On my way back home, I heard an unfamiliar call in a tree, and saw what I'm all but sure was an an Arctic warbler (I had seen the same bird before), before it flew off and disappeared into a thicket; but I hold off on claiming total confidence in this ID, as apparently it is all but impossible to distinguish between two other locally occurring kinds of warbler: the Japanese and Kamchatka leaf warblers. I will be sure to be on the lookout for this bird next time.

# 11/15–11/19

It has been four weeks since my all-too-short a trip to America. I miss New York terribly, especially Central Park, where I went nearly everyday and got to know many birds. Since coming back I've religiously maintained the habit of going out early every morning for one or two hours to bird. Though nothing in my immediate surroundings can remotely compare to a New York City park, I remain pleasantly surprised by the wealth of bird species within a half-mile of my house and continue never to know what I might run into. Since my last entry, I have ascertained five more species: striated grassbird, chestnut munia, collared kingfisher, cinnamon bittern, and yellow bittern.

All five are very interesting birds: the chestnut munia and collared kingfisher were both species I had been wanting very much to find around here, and both of them I sighted totally unexpectedly: the former when I went to check out a grassy site just beyond my usual range where a fellow birder I met last week told me she saw a Philippine swamphen; and the latter when I made a detour for no particular reason and saw it perched on a telephone wire. I have often made memorable first sightings in such ways.

The last couple of days, I spent some time studying the differences between two pairs of similar birds: 1) striated and tawny grassbirds, and 2) cinnamon and yellow bitterns. To the best of my knowledge, I have yet to see a tawny grassbird around these parts, but I've become more certain of my ability to distinguish yellow from cinnamon bitterns. Yesterday, as I was following a striated grassbird around, I saw a cinnamon bittern fly into a tree; the more-or-less even coloration was pretty distinct. Whereas today, I saw a pair of small bitterns briefly in flight, where the black in their wings gave it away that they were yellow bitterns. To top it all off, I got a good look at a beautiful Javan pond-heron staying still for several minutes.

# 11/20–11/26

Things have slowed down a bit, but new first-time sightings continue to be had. Monday morning as I was walking toward my usual site, at a very precise moment, I saw a somewhat large, light grayish bird overhead flying towards the field on the other side of the road. I had never seen it before. As I looked through my binocular I thought at first that it was some kind of gull (which would have been very unusual), but when it got closer and I saw its black cap, I knew I was looking at a black-crowned night-heron (it helped that I had been reading my field guides a lot and studying the different herons that occur locally) just before it disappeared into the vegetation. Later that same morning, I saw a barred rail under a thick cover of grass; I had been wanting to find one for a while. It disappeared very quickly but it was easy to identify.

Later in the week, I got a closer look at one of the sandpiper-like birds I had been seeing regularly that were too far away to make out properly. Sandpipers, plovers, etc., are very challenging to tell apart. Whereas I previously assumed it was a common sandpiper, its longish legs and speckled back ruled it out; my best ID for it is wood sandpiper. 

Because I bird so much in wide open spaces I had been wishing a lot that I had a spotting scope, so I went ahead and got a little one (a Celestron Hummingbird) just in time for the holiday sales. Though small and not that powerful, it has been a game changer in seeing distant water birds in more detail than my 8x42 binocular can manage. My last certain first-time ID for the week was, as it turned out, a common sandpiper – clearly a different species from the other sandpiper I saw the other day.

# 11/27–12/16

Last few weeks have been quiet, though I continue to spend nearly every morning at my local wetland observing the herons and stilts. No new first-time sightings until Thursday, 12/14, where I met up first thing in the morning at Victoria Valley in Antipolo with a few fellow birders from the Wild Bird Club. We hoped in particular to see a Philippine hawk-eagle; and although we could hear birds in abundance, few came out in the open. Some new species for me: elegant tit, lowland white-eye, Philippine cuckoo-dove, Philippine bulbul. Other birds sighted: black-naped oriole, collared kingfisher, red-keeled flowerpecker, among others. My more experienced companions could hear more birds I hadn't seen, such as the tawny grassbird, and there were a few other potential sightings as well that I missed. A site worth visiting again in the near future.

# 12/17–12/22

Early Sunday morning, went to Las Piñas-Parañaque Wetland Park. along Manila Bay for a guided bird tour with the Wild Bird Club. It was the most fun I've had birding in the Philippines so far, especially because I got to put my new spotting scope to the test in a real wetland environment. I arrived at the visitors' center just a little after 6, when the sun had not fully come out yet. Immediately, out in the open in a small mudflat exposed by the low tide, the early comers and I were greeted by about a dozen little egrets punctuated by common and collared kingfishers, whiskered terns, a black-crowned night-heron, and – a first-time sighting for me – a striated heron. The tour started here, where we observed the birds for a while, before making our way to the beach on the other side of the park where there was a much larger mudflat.

With the naked eye, it was hard to make out anything in the distance except for egrets, but with magnification, the mudflat was teeming gloriously with waders of all sorts. Here my little Celestron Hummingbird performed admirably despite being massively outclassed by our guide's Swarovski, and helped me make a few more first-time sightings: Pacific golden plover, common redshank, common greenshank, and Kentish plover. Our guide explained some of the differences between the different waders present. Ostensibly there were little-ringed plovers as well, but I was not able to see them with certainty.

Afterwards we moved on to a pond in the island's forested interior where we saw many of the water birds I typically see near my home: white-browed crakes, white-breasted waterhens, common moorhens, and various herons. There were a few juvenile night herons (likely black-crowned) out in the open, as well as yellow bitterns and striated herons. One highlight was a spectacular purple heron that perched on top of a tall tree and posed for a good several minutes before flying away. Finally, I saw for the first time a rufous (or nankeen) night-heron, which was strikingly beautiful.

The last part of the trip was the boardwalk through the island's mangrove forest. We did not see many birds, except, notably, for some little egrets, and a couple of black-winged stilts. One thing I found hard not to notice was just how much garbage – either from Manila Bay or from people who had been working there – had found its way into the area. It was very disappointing, and an all-too-stark reminder of modern Philippine culture's nonexistent reverence for natural beauty. The very end of the boardwalk was unfinished and overlooked another mudflat off the mainland; in the distance, I made out several gray herons and egrets, but it was also full of garbage.

The following days were a blur as I was particularly busy at work, preventing religious daily outings. Yesterday morning I did get to go out just in my neighborhood and saw for the first time a very visually striking buff-banded rail. I also saw a couple of other birds that I didn't recognize and failed to ID; one looked like an Arctic warbler, or even a reed warbler of some sort, but I still wasn't sure. The other was more distant and hard to make out, but it was about the size of a grassbird, had a long tail, a black band over the eye (or so I thought), and some black on its back. Perhaps I'll see it again next time.

# 12/23

I had planned to join some other birders this morning all the way in Baras, Rizal but holiday errands got in the way. Instead, I kept myself to my neighborhood and found time to bird for an hour or so. The pond was a bit of a letdown; lately I noticed that there were fewer and fewer black-winged stilts, and today they were totally gone. Instead, there were a dozen or so cattle (or intermediate?) egrets in the distance. I still saw my usual great egret and purple heron, but overall it was rather quiet and I didn't stay very long.

On my way back, I saw a rather large, plump bird perched out in the open with a very striking coloration. I had seen a bird weeks earlier in the same spot zip in and out very quickly between some trees, making out only its bright blue and black wings. It was an uncommon sight and I was very surprised by it, but today confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things: it was a stunning brown-breasted kingfisher (or white-throated kingfisher, _Halcyon gularis_, according to the Allen field guide), a Philippine endemic only fairly recently reclassified as a separate species from _H. smyrnensis_, also (confusingly) known as the white-throated, or white-breasted, kingfisher. At any rate, it was an amazing sight, and will go down as a memorable 100th "lifer" since I started birding this year.

</div>

Almost immediately after, I saw for the first time an unfamiliar blackish bird with a decurved bill perched high on a telephone wire. In the past I had seen crested mynas and white-breasted woodswallows in that same spot. But when I got a closer look and saw its red eyes, I knew I was looking at an Asian glossy starling.

Finally, in a tall tree on the way home, I caught sight of a beautiful pair of blue-tailed bee-eaters. I had seen one before, but only once and very fleetingly. Of course, I walked around the block to get closer to the tree and get a better look, and observed them hawking for a while. One would burst off and snatch an insect mid-flight, return to the same perch, and hit the insect repeatedly against the tree. It was a spectacular sight. A little later, they were joined in the same tree by some yellow-vented bulbuls, Java sparrows, scaly-breasted munias, and a red-keeled flowerpecker.
