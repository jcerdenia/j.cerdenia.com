# 10/23â€“10/29

Arrived back at MNL late at night on the 23rd after a month in America. Early next morning, I was roused by the harsh, grating call outside my window of what I would later identify as the brown shrike, a winter visitor to these parts. Sleek and handsome, but apparently a "butcher bird." Immediately went out and began the week's birding.

My neighborhood east of the capital region is home to dozens of species due to considerable undeveloped wetland. Between the time I started birding in July and 10/23 I identified 12 species with certainty: 1) Eurasian tree sparrow, 2) yellow-vented bulbul, 3) olive-backed sunbird, 4) zebra dove, 5) Philippine pied fantail, 6) black-naped oriole, 7) rock pigeon, 8) golden-bellied gerygone, 9) Java sparrow, 10) large-billed crow, 11) white-breasted waterhen, and 12) crested myna (see also: [my running life list](/birding-life-list)). Most of these are common urban birds likely to be encountered as soon as one ventures out the door; some are not that common but can be expected to be seen with regularity. The golden-bellied gerygone is a particularly interesting case because its song is ubiquitous, but the bird itself is not such a common sight due to its small size.

It seems the experience I gained from all the birding I did in America paid off. Between 10/24 and today, 10/29, I ascertained 13 more species: 13) brown shrike, 14) white-breasted woodswallow, 15) spotted dove, 16) white-browed crake, 17) common moorhen, 18) coppersmith barbet, 19) cattle egret, 20) grey heron, 21) purple heron, 22) whiskered tern, 23) red-keeled flowerpecker, 24) scaly-breasted munia, and 25) Philippine glossy swiftlet. To these I might add a few more species that I believe I'm reasonably correct about, but do not claim certainty: barred rail, Arctic warbler, house swallow, barn swallow. In time I hope to be certain about them. And there are even more species I've sighted that I have not yet come close to identifying.

Of the 25 species listed above, my favorites are the yellow-vented bulbul, Philippine pied fantail, and coppersmith barbet. The bulbuls are abundant but always elegant and beautiful; one can never get tired of seeing them. The pied fantails, endemic to these islands, are feisty little birds with gorgeous tails despite their otherwise unremarkable coloration. The colorful barbet is the most visually striking bird I've yet seen in these parts. I have only seen them on two occasions in the same tree; I hope there are more of them.

The whole week I birded only my neighborhood wetland, except for this afternoon (Sunday, 10/29), which I spent at Heritage Memorial Park in Taguig. There, I met the president and some members of the Wild Bird Club of the Philippines in a chance encounter. I saw the usual urban birds (tree sparrows, pied fantails, swiftlets) and a few waterbirds (waterhens, moorhens, egrets) but no new species.

10.30. Morning. Immediately saw the red-keeled flowerpecker for the second time, a stunning little bird. Not such a common sight; seems to favor being high up on trees. Glad I saw it again. A little later, sighted the latest addition to my running list of 25 neighborhood species: the **26) Philippine pygmy woodpecker,** a lone specimen in the same leafless tree that I saw the barbets last week. Then, venturing out closer to a large pond, saw a beautiful grey heron and a **27) little egret** (distinguished from the cattle egret by its more slender build and dark bill) close by. Other familiar sights were bulbuls, moorhens, terns, and swiftlets and/or swallows. In another watery spot, I got a great view of a mature purple heron, with its distinct coloration. Also saw, for a moment, a small reddish heron-like bird land and disappear quickly into the vegetation (cinnamon bittern?) while I was looking at something else, as well as several of what looked like plovers or sandpipers, but I could not come to any confident identifications.

10.31. Morning. Quiet. But saw small flock of black-winged stilts in flight; very fleeting but distinct. Long dark bills, orange legs trailing behind flight, distinct black-and-white coloration.
Afternoon. Heritage. Cinnamon bitterns.

11.1. Good view of flock of black-winged stilts. Grey herons. The return of the coppersmith barbets.
