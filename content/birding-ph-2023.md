# 10/23–10/29

Arrived back at MNL late at night on the 23rd after a month in America. Early next morning, I was roused by the harsh, grating call outside my window of what I would later identify as the brown shrike, a winter visitor to these parts. Sleek and handsome, but apparently a "butcher bird." Immediately went out and began the week's birding.

My neighborhood east of the capital region is home to dozens of species due to considerable undeveloped wetland. Between the time I started birding in July and 10/23 I identified 12 species with certainty: **1) Eurasian tree sparrow, 2) yellow-vented bulbul, 3) olive-backed sunbird, 4) zebra dove, 5) Philippine pied fantail, 6) black-naped oriole, 7) rock pigeon, 8) golden-bellied gerygone, 9) Java sparrow, 10) large-billed crow, 11) white-breasted waterhen,** and **12) crested myna** (see also: [my running life list](/birding-life-list)). Most of these are common urban birds likely to be encountered as soon as one ventures out the door; some are not that common but can be expected to be seen with regularity. The golden-bellied gerygone is a particularly interesting case because its song is ubiquitous, but the bird itself is not such a common sight due to its small size.

It seems the experience I gained from all the birding I did in America paid off. Between 10/24 and today, 10/29, I ascertained 13 more species: **13) brown shrike, 14) white-breasted woodswallow, 15) spotted dove, 16) white-browed crake, 17) common moorhen, 18) coppersmith barbet, 19) cattle egret, 20) grey heron, 21) purple heron, 22) whiskered tern, 23) red-keeled flowerpecker, 24) scaly-breasted munia,** and **25) Philippine glossy (or grey-rumped) swiftlet.** To these I might add a few more species that I believe I'm reasonably correct about, but do not claim certainty: barred rail, Arctic warbler, house swallow, barn swallow. In time I hope to be certain about them. And there are even more species I've sighted that I have not yet come close to identifying.

Of the 25 species listed above, my favorites are the yellow-vented bulbul, Philippine pied fantail, and coppersmith barbet. The bulbuls are abundant but always elegant and beautiful; one can never get tired of seeing them. The pied fantails, endemic to these islands, are feisty little birds with gorgeous tails despite their otherwise unremarkable coloration. The colorful barbet is the most visually striking bird I've yet seen in these parts. I have only seen them on two occasions in the same tree; I hope there are more of them.

The whole week I birded only my neighborhood wetland, except for this afternoon (Sunday, 10/29), which I spent at Heritage Memorial Park in Taguig. There, I met the president and some members of the [Wild Bird Club of the Philippines](https://birdwatch.ph) in a chance encounter. I saw the usual urban birds (tree sparrows, pied fantails, swiftlets) and a few waterbirds (waterhens, moorhens, egrets) but no new species.

# 10/30–11/05

The first morning of the week saw the newest addition to my running list of local species: a lone **26) Philippine pygmy woodpecker,** which I spotted in the same tree that I saw the barbets last week. I greatly enjoyed seeing different American woodpeckers last month see my – as of now quite modest – [life list](/birding-life-list)); so I'm glad that my own neck of the woods has its own species of woodpecker. Another addition early in the week was the **27) little egret,** distinguished from the cattle egret by its more slender build and dark-colored bill. 

Last Sunday morning, 10/29, a fellow birder found me and told me about some **28) black-winged stilts** that are wintering in the area. Wednesday morning, 10/31, I saw a small flock of them in flight over the neighborhood lake before landing and disappearing quickly into the surrounding vegetation. It was very fleeting, but they were very distinctive: long dark bills, orange legs trailing behind in flight. That same afternoon, 10/31, I returned to Heritage Memorial Park and sighted a couple of **29) cinnamon bitterns** around the lake. Apart from that, the suite of birds is basically the same as in my neighborhood. 

Next day, the black-winged stilts were still there; I entered a construction site jutting out into the lake to get a better view. Other familiar sights were moorhens, grey and purple herons, egrets, terns, and swiftlets and/or swallows (any of which I have yet to identify with certainty). Also saw the coppersmith barbets again (8 of them) in their favorite tree; they seem to perch there only a little while, possibly only once every morning, before flying off together into the trees off the road.

Saturday morning, 11/04, I went on a guided bird walk with the Wild Bird Club around the University of the Philippines, a popular and accessible birding spot in Metro Manila. Crested mynas and black-naped orioles were abundant. Also saw three new species: **30) long-tailed shrike** (a local resident, even more handsome than the migrant brown shrike), **31) pied triller,** and, with some reservation because it was small and hard to see, **32) pygmy flowerpecker.** Happy to say I am now a member of the Wild Bird Club, which should lead to some interesting birding trips in the future.

Finally, this morning, 11/05, I identified a group of **33) common sandpipers** in the nearby marshes. Also saw a medium-sized brownish bird flitting around some tall grass; my first guess was some kind of grassbird, but I could not come to a confident answer; hope I see it again. In addition, it bears mentioning another highlight throughout the week, which was seeing more of the red-keeled flowerpecker around my neighborhood; a tiny but visually stunning species.
