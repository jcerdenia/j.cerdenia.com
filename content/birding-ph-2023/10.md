Early morning, still quiet at the pond. I noticed a handful of black-winged stilts, about three or four. The gray heron was also there; it's nice to see it still around. The egrets, still about a dozen of them, were all the way at the very far end. Didn't stay very long.

Instead, I stayed mostly in the relatively wooded areas around the canal that runs through the village. Saw the buff-banded rail again, hidden in some grass, which was beautiful. I thought it could be easily mistaken for a white-browed crake if one wasn't looking carefully. I really wanted to see the brown-breasted kingfisher again so I lingered around the same area I saw it yesterday, and after a short while... there it was! But it flew behind a house and disappeared. Also saw a Philippine pygmy woodpecker and noticed for the first time just how loud its pecking can be for such a tiny bird.

Finally, passed by the same tree yesterday where I saw the blue-tailed bee-eaters, and again they were there hawking for insects. Sharing the tree were a few yellow-vented bulbuls and Java sparrows. After some time of getting familiar with the local avian wildlife, one gets the sense that they _can_ often be predictable; and it's nice to know they can reliably be expected to turn up in the same places.
