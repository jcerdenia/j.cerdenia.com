The final week of the year has shaped up to be hectic as far as work goes, and birding-wise uneventful. On days where going out is not possible, I content myself with birding from home, where I have the advantage of big windows, nearby trees, and a building across the street where Java sparrows, Eurasian tree sparrows, yellow-vented bulbuls, rock doves, and large-billed crows often come to hang out. Early in the week, for the first time in my neighborhood, I spotted pied trillers in the trees.

As for the pond, it has continued to be quiet, though I've noticed more and more egrets. The other day I counted about two dozen of them in the distance – a mix of cattle and/or intermediate egrets, little egrets, and one or two great egrets. The blacked-winged stilts are also back, though not as many as before; there are small groups of them scattered throughout the site. Other than these, whiskered terns, crested mynas, moorhens, pond herons, and purple herons have continued to be common sights.
