I had been meaning to check out Angono Lakeside so-called "Eco-Park" for some time, which is less than a half-hour's drive away, but when I got there at not even 7 in the morning – what a dump! Crowded, loud music blasting every which way, trash and dog excrement everywhere. A massive reclamation site blocked the view of the lake entirely, so what was the point? The many terns flitting around next to the main visitors' area did not seem to mind, but I did. I walked all the way over to the edge of the reclaimed ground to get a decent view – or any view, for that matter. On the upside, the morning light was lovely and I got beautiful views of little egrets and purple herons, and even watched a yellow bittern fly an impressive distance over the dense aquatic vegetation. But the noise and filth were very irritating and I stayed for only a few minutes before walking back to my car. I won't be visiting again.

When I got home around 8, I felt dissatisfied by the lack of birding I'd done and immediately walked to my usual site and set up my spotting scope by the pond. I lost track of time as I went to-and-fro among views of a great egret, a little egret, and a small flock of black-winged stilts, all of which never moved away the whole time – and I never get tired of them as well. My hometown, and the whole of the greater Manila area, may be a cultural and spiritual wasteland as far as I'm concerned, but birding is about finding hidden beauty where you don't expect it; and there's still plenty to be found just outside the door without needing to venture very far.
