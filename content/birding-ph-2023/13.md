Interesting final bird walk of the year, despite staying only in Santa Ana. Instead of directly heading to the pond, I lingered around a relatively dry grassy patch where I've often seen birds that seem to appear nowhere else in the village, such as barred rails, buff-banded rails, and yet-to-be-identified warbler-like birds. Sure enough, I immediately spotted a buff-banded rail. But a short distance from it, I noticed a squat, stationary bird hidden in the grass: a snipe of some kind. Snipes, like other waders, are known to be difficult to tell apart, but the following scant details make me, a first-time snipe-seer, lean towards it being Swinhoe's snipe:

1. The most similar species is the pintail snipe, which is less common and occurs as a rare winter visitor in only a handful of small patches throughout the country, according to the Allen field guide. Another similar species, Latham's snipe, is a vagrant and very unlikely. Swinhoe's is common and widespread – "the commonest snipe in the region." Merlin totally omits the pintail and Latham's snipes in this location, leaving the common snipe as the only other candidate.

2. The common snipe has a "supercilium typically narrower than rather broad loral-stripe at base of bill" (Allen); my snipe has a narrow loral strip and broader supercilium.

3. More superficially, the common snipe is more contrastingly colored, my snipe less so. Comparing a dozen photos each of common and Swinhoe's snipes seems to confirm this.

At any rate, the snipe shyly slipped away under the thick grass as soon as I managed to take a few crude pictures through my scope, and I saw nothing of its tail at all (usually helpful in identification) nor its wings in flight, so this is going in the "provisional" list. I hope I see it again.

I made my way to the pond where my usual great egret was perched atop its favorite wooden pole, but I felt a hankering to get closer to the other egrets on the far end of the site. I continued walking along the road around the edge of the pond until the water was no longer in sight – replaced by shoddy buildings and piles of trash on the sidewalk – until I reached a modestly sized paddy field by a warehouse building where there were about a dozen or so egrets scattered about. Then I realized there was a better vantage point from a tiny gated village adjacent to it that was unguarded. I entered the site and was treated to a perfect and fairly private view of three species of egret (cattle, little, and intermediate) waddling about and foraging in the mud – a little School of Egret Identification, if you will. There were also a few whiskered terns floating around. Only the harsh sun (by this time it was close to 10:00) prevented me from staying as long as I wanted, but I intend to visit again at an earlier hour and see if they're still there.
