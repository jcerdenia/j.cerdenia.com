I continue to be surprised by the diversity of wild birds around my neighborhood wetland; though the rate of my identifying new species has slowed down since the last two weeks, I still never know what I might run into. Early in the week, on 11/06, I saw a small heron whose red-brownish head was poking out of some tall grass. Its head and neck was somewhat streaked, and it had a distinctive black-tipped bill. Several seconds after I spotted it, it flew out of its position and disappeared; in flight, its wings were all-white. I identified as a Javan pond-heron, a fairly common resident species according to my field guide.

Later that same day, while I was working at home, an unfamiliar bird perched on a telephone wire right outside my window. At first I thought I was finally looking at a kingfisher (which I had been wanting to find for some time); it had an overall blue-greenish color but its bill was noticeably sleeker and more pointed. I identified it as a blue-tailed bee-eater, yet another fairly common and widespread resident. I hope I see it again.

The next few days I expected not much, but as I was on my walk one afternoon a swallow glided overhead, from which I was able to clearly make out its deeply forked tail, indicating a barn swallow. Later, I was able to tell it apart from the Pacific swallow , another locally common swallow species. A point of confusion: my field guide, _Birds of the Philippines_ from Lynx and BirdLife International indicates House Swallow (_Hirundo javanica_) instead of Pacific Swallow (_Hirundo tahitica_). According to the taxonomic note on this species: "Previously treated as conspecific with extralimital Tahiti Swallow _H. tahitica_ ... under name Pacific Swallow." Tentatively, I stick to the (seemingly) more locally common designation of Pacific Swallow, but they are the same bird.

Friday morning, 11/10, I spent the better part of an hour following an egret around as it waded slowly across the pond and taking many (poor) pictures through my binocular; after consulting my field guides (here my North American field guides proved useful outside their jurisdiction; I have the National Geographic 7th ed. and _Sibley Birds East_) as well as other resources online, I became confident that it was a great egret. And finally, Sunday morning, 11/12, I saw for the first time a common kingfisher, which I was just able to make out in the distance.
