Perhaps it is better to do these entries daily, or almost daily, rather than weekly so that I don't forget details. I don't anticipate identifying new species at the same rate as I did in the preceding weeks; but birds do not become less interesting just because I've seen them before. For example, yesterday morning, 11/13, I spotted a Philippine pygmy woodpecker in a different tree from the one in which I usually see them. While they are not abundant, they might be more common in this area than I thought.

This morning, 11/14, I received a spectacular lesson from the egrets in telling different species apart; it is really much easier when you are able to see and compare all of them at once. There was a great egret, in typical great egret fashion as I've come to know, wading slowly across the water; its very long and slender neck occasionally stretched out. Meanwhile, I spent a good amount of time observing two intermediate egrets – which I identified by their more rounded heads (more rounded than the great egret's), slightly stocky frames, and conspicuously black-tipped bills – chasing (?) each other and flitting around the pond; they are spectacular fliers, and one could never tire of watching them. From time to time, and for good measure, a little egret would show up, easily distinguished by its small size and black bill. Also present were gray herons, purple herons, whiskered terns, common moorhens, and black-winged stilts. All in all they make for a dazzling sight that makes me wonder what pathetic stupor I'd been in all this time not to notice that this place is absolutely teeming with life.

On my way back home, I heard an unfamiliar call in a tree, and saw what I'm all but sure was an an Arctic warbler (I had seen the same bird before), before it flew off and disappeared into a thicket; but I hold off on claiming total confidence in this ID, as apparently it is all but impossible to distinguish between two other locally occurring kinds of warbler: the Japanese and Kamchatka leaf warblers. I will be sure to be on the lookout for this bird next time.
