Last few weeks have been quiet, though I continue to spend nearly every morning at my local wetland observing the herons and stilts. No new first-time sightings until Thursday, 12/14, where I met up first thing in the morning at Victoria Valley in Antipolo with a few fellow birders from the Wild Bird Club. We hoped in particular to see a Philippine hawk-eagle; and although we could hear birds in abundance, few came out in the open. Some new species for me: elegant tit, lowland white-eye, Philippine cuckoo-dove, Philippine bulbul. Other birds sighted: black-naped oriole, collared kingfisher, red-keeled flowerpecker, among others. My more experienced companions could hear more birds I hadn't seen, such as the tawny grassbird, and there were a few other potential sightings as well that I missed. A site worth visiting again in the near future.
