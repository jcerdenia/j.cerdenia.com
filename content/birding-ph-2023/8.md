Early Sunday morning, went to Las Piñas-Parañaque Wetland Park along Manila Bay for a guided bird tour with the Wild Bird Club. It was the most fun I've had birding in the Philippines so far, especially because I got to put my new spotting scope to the test in a real wetland environment. I arrived at the visitors' center just a little after 6, when the sun had not fully come out yet. Immediately, out in the open in a small mudflat exposed by the low tide, the early comers and I were greeted by about a dozen little egrets punctuated by common and collared kingfishers, whiskered terns, a black-crowned night-heron, and – a first-time sighting for me – a striated heron. The tour started here, where we observed the birds for a while, before making our way to the beach on the other side of the park where there was a much larger mudflat.

With the naked eye, it was hard to make out anything in the distance except for egrets, but with magnification, the mudflat was teeming gloriously with waders of all sorts. Here my little Celestron Hummingbird performed admirably despite being massively outclassed by our guide's Swarovski, and helped me make a few more first-time sightings: Pacific golden plover, common redshank, common greenshank, and Kentish plover. Our guide explained some of the differences between the different waders present. Ostensibly there were little-ringed plovers as well, but I was not able to see them with certainty.

Afterwards we moved on to a pond in the island's forested interior where we saw many of the water birds I typically see near my home: white-browed crakes, white-breasted waterhens, common moorhens, and various herons. There were a few juvenile night herons (likely black-crowned) out in the open, as well as yellow bitterns and striated herons. One highlight was a spectacular purple heron that perched on top of a tall tree and posed for a good several minutes before flying away. Finally, I saw for the first time a rufous (or nankeen) night-heron, which was strikingly beautiful.

The last part of the trip was the boardwalk through the island's mangrove forest. We did not see many birds, except, notably, for some little egrets, and a couple of black-winged stilts. One thing I found hard not to notice was just how much garbage – either from Manila Bay or from people who had been working there – had found its way into the area. It was very disappointing, and an all-too-stark reminder of modern Philippine culture's nonexistent reverence for natural beauty. The very end of the boardwalk was unfinished and overlooked another mudflat off the mainland; in the distance, I made out several gray herons and egrets, but it was also full of garbage.

The following days were a blur as I was particularly busy at work, preventing religious daily outings. Yesterday morning I did get to go out just in my neighborhood and saw for the first time a very visually striking buff-banded rail. I also saw a couple of other birds that I didn't recognize and failed to ID; one looked like an Arctic warbler, or even a reed warbler of some sort, but I still wasn't sure. The other was more distant and hard to make out, but it was about the size of a grassbird, had a long tail, a black band over the eye (or so I thought), and some black on its back. Perhaps I'll see it again next time.
