I had planned to join some other birders this morning all the way in Baras, Rizal but holiday errands got in the way. Instead, I kept myself to my neighborhood and found time to bird for an hour or so. The pond was a bit of a letdown; lately I noticed that there were fewer and fewer black-winged stilts, and today they were totally gone. Instead, there were a dozen or so cattle (or intermediate?) egrets in the distance. I still saw my usual great egret and purple heron, but overall it was rather quiet and I didn't stay very long.

On my way back, I saw a rather large, plump bird perched out in the open with a very striking coloration. I had seen a bird weeks earlier in the same spot zip in and out very quickly between some trees, making out only its bright blue and black wings. It was an uncommon sight and I was very surprised by it, but today confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things: it was a stunning brown-breasted kingfisher (or white-throated kingfisher, _Halcyon gularis_, according to the Allen field guide), a Philippine endemic only fairly recently reclassified as a separate species from _H. smyrnensis_, also (confusingly) known as the white-throated, or white-breasted, kingfisher. At any rate, it was an amazing sight, and will go down as a memorable 100th "lifer" since I started birding this year.

Almost immediately after, I saw for the first time an unfamiliar blackish bird with a decurved bill perched high on a telephone wire. In the past I had seen crested mynas and white-breasted woodswallows in that same spot. But when I got a closer look and saw its red eyes, I knew I was looking at an Asian glossy starling.

Finally, in a tall tree on the way home, I caught sight of a beautiful pair of blue-tailed bee-eaters. I had seen one before, but only once and very fleetingly. Of course, I walked around the block to get closer to the tree and get a better look, and observed them hawking for a while. One would burst off and snatch an insect mid-flight, return to the same perch, and hit the insect repeatedly against the tree. It was a spectacular sight. A little later, they were joined in the same tree by some yellow-vented bulbuls, Java sparrows, scaly-breasted munias, and a red-keeled flowerpecker.
