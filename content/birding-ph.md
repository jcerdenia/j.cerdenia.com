# 10/23–10/29

Arrived back in MNL late at night on the 23rd after one month in America. Early next morning, I was roused by the harsh, grating call outside my window of what I would later identify as the brown shrike, a winter visitor to these parts. Small bird, sleek and handsome, but apparently a "butcher bird." Immediately went out and began the week's birding.

My neighborhood east of the capital region is home to dozens of species due to considerable undeveloped wetland. Between the time I started birding in July and 10/23 I identified 12 species with certainty: 1) Eurasian tree sparrow, 2) yellow-vented bulbul, 3) olive-backed sunbird, 4) zebra dove, 5) Philippine pied fantail, 6) black-naped oriole, 7) rock pigeon, 8) golden-bellied gerygone, 9) Jave sparrow, 10) large-billed crow, 11) white-breasted waterhen, 12) crested myna. Most of these are common urban birds likely to be encountered as soon as one ventures out the door; some are not that common but can be expected to be seen with regularity. The golden-bellied gerygone is a particularly interesting case because its song is ubiquitous, but the bird itself is not such a common sight due to its small size.

It seems the experience I gained from all the birding I did in America paid off. Between 10/24 and today, 10/29, I ascertained 13 more species: 13) brown shrike, 14) white-breasted woodswallow, 15) spotted dove, 16) white-browed crake, 17) common moorhen, 18) coppersmith barbet, 19) cattle egret, 20) grey heron, 21) purple heron, 22) whiskered tern, 23) red-keeled flowerpecker, 24) scaly-breasted munia, and 25) Philippine glossy swiftlet. To these I might add a few more species that I believe I'm reasonably correct about, but do not claim certainty: barred rail, house swallow, barn swallow. In time I hope to be certain about them. And there are even more species I've sighted that I have not yet come close to identifying.

Of the 25 species listed above, my favorites are the yellow-vented bulbul, Philippine pied fantail, and coppersmith barbet. The bulbuls are abundant but always elegant and beautiful; one can never get tired of seeing them. The pied fantails are feisty little birds with gorgeous tails, despite their otherwise unremarkable coloration. The colorful barbet is the most visually striking bird I've yet seen in these parts. I have only seen them on two occasions in the same tree; I hope there are more of them.

The whole week I birded only in my neighborhood wetland, except for this afternoon (Sunday, 10/29), which I spent at Heritage Memorial Park in Taguig. There, I met the president and some members of the Wild Bird Club of the Philippines in a chance encounter. I saw the usual urban birds (tree sparrows, pied fantails, swiftlets) and a few waterbirds (waterhens, moorhens, egrets) but no new species.
