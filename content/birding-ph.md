# 10/23–10/29

Arrived back in MNL late at night on the 23rd after one month in America. Early next morning, woken up by the harsh, grating call of what I would later identify as the brown shrike, a winter visitor to these parts. Small bird, sleek and handsome, but apparently a "butcher bird." Immediately went out and began the week's birding.

My neighborhood east of Metro Manila is host to dozens of species due to considerable wetland. By 10/23 I had identified 12 species with certainty: 1) Eurasian tree sparrow, 2) yellow-vented bulbul, 3) olive-backed sunbird, 4) zebra dove, 5) Philippine pied fantail, 6) Java sparrow, 7) golden-bellied gerygone, 8) black-naped oriole, 9) rock pigeon, 10) white-breasted waterhen, 11) crested myna, 12) large-billed crow. Most are very common birds that one is likely to encounter as soon as one ventures out the door; some are less common but can be expected to be seen with regularity. The golden-bellied gerygone is a particularly interesting case because its song is ubiquitous, but the bird itself is difficult to spot due to its small size.

It seems all the time I spent birding in America paid off with valuable experience. Between 10/24 and today, 10/29, I ascertained 13 more species: 13) brown shrike, 14) white-breasted woodswallow, 15) spotted dove, 16) white-browed crake, 17) common moorhen, 18) coppersmith barbet, 19) cattle egret, 20) grey heron, 21) purple heron, 22) whiskered tern, 23) red-keeled flowerpecker, 24) scaly-breasted munia, and 25) Philippine glossy swiftlet. To these I might add a few more species that I believe I'm reasonably correct about, but do not claim certainty: barred rail, house swallow, barn swallow. In time I hope to be certain about them. It goes without saying there are more species I've sighted that I have not yet come close to identifying.

Of the 25 species I've identified so far, my favorites are the yellow-vented bulbul, Philippine pied fantail, and coppersmith barbet. The bulbuls are abundant but beautiful; one can never get tired of seeing them. The pied fantails are feisty little birds with gorgeous tails. The colorful barbet is the most visually striking bird I've yet seen in these parts. I have only seen them on two occasions in the same tree; I hope to see more of them.

The whole week I birded only in my neighborhood wetland, except for this afternoon (Sunday, 10/29), which I spent at Heritage Memorial Park in Taguig. There, I met the president and some members of the Wild Bird Club of the Philippines in a chance encounter. I saw the usual urban birds (tree sparrows, pied fantails, swiftlets) and a few waterbirds (waterhens, moorhens, egrets) but no new species.
