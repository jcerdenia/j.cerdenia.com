I couldn't let the new year begin in earnest without a little retrospective about my trip to America in the autumn of 2023. If you know me at all, you know how much I regret my decision to leave New York City in 2020 after having already semi-established myself there. Life in the Philippines is not for me – a temporary setback that grows increasingly tiresome every year. Discovering the joys of birding halfway through 2023 was a small mercy from the heavens that revealed to me a layer of magic that underlies the crude appearances of reality. Where previously I could not even manage a ten-minute walk without becoming inconsolably depressed about the vile tropical heat and ugly urban hellscape, now I easily do hours every day. Where previously there was nothing to see or go to, now, suddenly, there is more than I can imagine.

I adopted birding as my way of transporting myself away from my many disappointments about my circumstances. So when I traveled to America in September in October, where I needed no transporting away from anything, I did not expect that it would turn into my first birding expedition. Until that point, I had only identified my first 12 species in Santa Ana, and mostly from my window; I had started going on bird walks in July, at first only armed with the Merlin app (and managing to identify a White-breasted Waterhen on my first try), until seeing a Black-naped Oriole the next month prompted me to buy a cheapo 350-peso binocular. I brought that same binocular with me to San Francisco in September, where, on my first day after arriving, I took two buses from Daly City and walked from Inner Sunset up to and through the western edge of the Presidio, along the spectacular coast.

The first thing I noticed was the abundance of American Crows and Common Ravens; I took note of how large they were, especially ravens, compared to the Philippines' most conspicuous birds, the Eurasian Tree Sparrows. Walking through Golden Gate Park and around Stow Lake, I was filled once more with the satisfaction of being in an open park with tall trees, green meadows, and cool air. Around the lake, I lingered a bit to admire the Mallards and Canada Geese, birds I had long been familiar with from my time in the States. I also saw for the first time the beautiful Red-Winged Blackbird. At the Presidio, amid a stunning view of the Golden Gate Bridge, I saw a striking blue bird with a black crest perched prominently before zooming off: Steller's Jay, a distinctive west-coast bird, which I would see again many times during my brief stay in California.
