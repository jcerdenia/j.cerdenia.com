Several weeks ago, I swung by the beautiful studio of the Philippines' only classical music radio station for a conversation with Daniel Federico, who hosts the _Maestro Filipino_ program. It was my second time at the station, which I grew up listening to, and, even though I was meeting Daniel for the first time, felt like catching up with an old friend. [This](https://redcircle.com/shows/987-dzfe-the-masters-touch/ep/a41b36b9-56ee-4e7c-9158-cb6d6a25729e) is the result.

We talk about musical life between New York and Manila, composing post-pandemic, theatre vs concert music, composing vs software development, etc., etc. I also share a few works that have some connection to home.
