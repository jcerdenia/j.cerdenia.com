<small>My current surroundings</small>

Hi, I'm Joshua. I lead a double life as a [software developer](https://github.com/joshuacerdenia) and [composer](https://music.cerdenia.com). This is my personal site, meant for anything that doesn't fall under my regular work. 

There's not much to see right now, but I'm working on it.

## Mailing List

I'm experimenting with a private [mailing list](http://tinyletter.com/jcletters) to share irregular updates on life and music on a personal scale. Join to make contact and exchange thoughts.
