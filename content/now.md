In the style of [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about)

- Living/melting in the Philippines, where I moved back to reboot after several years of “the artist life” in NYC. It ended up coinciding with the pandemic. It's comfortable here, but I'm looking for something else and working on my next long-term move.

- Laboring in obscurity as a software engineer at a fintech company.

- Working on a new musical, _Hay Fever_, which will make its first [in-person appearance](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hay-fever-a-new-musical-reading-tickets-495479341047) at Lincoln Center in June.

- Starting a new piece for orchestra.
