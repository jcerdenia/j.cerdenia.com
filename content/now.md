- Living/melting in Manila, Philippines and plotting my eventual return to NYC.

- Laboring in obscurity as a software engineer at a fintech company.

- Working on a musical, _Hay Fever_, which will make its first [in-person appearance](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hay-fever-a-new-musical-reading-tickets-495479341047) at Lincoln Center in June 2023.

- Working on a new orchestral piece that I may or may not finish.
