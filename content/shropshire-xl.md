I first encountered this little poem by A. E. Housman narrated over the final moments of the 1971 film _Walkabout_. Short but deeply moving, it has haunted me in various seasons of my life, especially lately. I felt a compulsion to render it in Tagalog.

Like many overeducated Filipinos of my station, I'm poorly read and barely literate in my own country's tongue, and offer the above in blissful ignorance of my own stupidity. All I know is that, in its less pedestrian forms, it is an exceedingly dignified language, naturally musical and given to poetry.

A few remarks:

_An air that kills:_ The Tagalog _mapaminsala_ is closer to "devastating" than "that kills", but the literal _nakamamatay_ (deadly) or _pumapatay_ (killing) has a sensational and vulgar effect.

_Blue remembered hills:_ Impossible (for me and my lack of patience anyway) to do both well and literally; _mga burol na bughaw sa alaala_ is closer to "the hills blue in memory," which is close enough in spirit.

_What spires, what farms:_ This evocative, musical line is my favorite. But Tagalog is so verbose, and I settled on a contracted form of what I would have preferred – _Anong mga tore, anong kabukiran?_ – which mirrors the English more closely, but disrupts the meter.

_Land of lost content:_ "Content," with its vague usage, is the single most challenging word in the poem. I have settled on _galak_ for musical reasons, even though it's closer to "joy." Tagalog nouns like _galak_ have a base, short form, which (to my mind) feels more abstract and ethereal; and one that is more concrete and earthly, e.g., _kagalakan_ (think, for instance, of the distinction between "joy" and "joyousness"). The former feels right in spirit, despite not being literally exact.

_I see it shining plain:_ My rendering is liberal and literally means "clear to my sight," but 1) _paningin_ is easier to rhyme with anything, and 2) the double meaning of _maliwanag_, which can be both "radiant" and "clear," is too good an opportunity.

_Happy highways:_ I wish I could reproduce the alliteration, but this is the best I can come up with right now. _Lansangan_ means street (there is no exact Tagalog for "highway"), and I wavered between it and _landas_ (path); but the former is more specific and less passé when paired with _tinahak_ (went through).
