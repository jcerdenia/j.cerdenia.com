Shouldn't all our efforts be directed to nothing other than the completion of that house?&quot;<p>To which he responds: &quot;To 'build our house' at this time implies not only securing survival, but also putting in order again our entire moral and intellectual heritage. And before any detailed plan along these lines can succeed, a new beginning, our re-foundation, calls out immediately for ... a defense of leisure.&quot;<h3>The claims of the world of total work</h3><p>From the outset we assume that we live today in a world of &quot;total work&quot; -- work as the prime human activity, an end in itself. &quot;Leisure,&quot; as popularly understood, stands in contrast to work; yet the original meaning of this word has been forgotten. After all the Greek word for leisure is the origin of the <em>scola</em>, <em>Schule</em>, and <em>school</em>. Leisure is one of the foundations of Western European culture.<p>Pieper writes: &quot; ... our inability to recover the original meaning of 'leisure', will stike us all the more when we realize how extensively the opposing idea of 'work' has invaded and taken over the whole realm of human action and of human existence as a whole; when we realize, as well, how ready we are to grant all claims made for the person who 'works'.&quot;<p>He goes on: &quot;An altered conception of the human being <em>as such</em>, and a new interpretation of the meaning of human existence <em>as such</em>, looms behind the new claims being made for 'work' and the 'worker'.&quot;<p>Note that by &quot;worker,&quot; Pieper uses the word in an anthropological sense: a &quot;general human ideal,&quot; not in the sociological sense of the &quot;proletarian worker.&quot;<div>‚Üê<a href="../">Go back</a></div></main>
