No technical definition is given; but we can tell, by how it's juxtaposed with &quot;living religious experience&quot; that dogma strikes us as something imposing, hard-line, rigid, and difficult to know. We can intuit from further reading that &quot;the dogmas&quot; refers to truth itself, as given by the Church.<p>&quot;The sole legimate way&quot;: implying that some other ways are seen to be legimitate ways to know the dogmas -- particularly, rationality. He reiterates the exclusivity: &quot;Only by relying on immediate experience can one survey the spiritual treasures of the Church and come to see their value.&quot;<p>Aside: he refers to his work as &quot;my book, or, rather, my jottings, which have been written at different times and in different moods,&quot; making us aware from the outset that this is not a work of cold, hard, logic but something more intuitive. Indeed, the way he emphasizes experience furthers his point: &quot;Only by passing a damp sponge over the ancient writings, can one wash them with living water and decipher the letters of the church literature.&quot; What is this damp sponge?<h3>II.</h3><p>&quot;The asceting saints of the Church are alive for the living and dead for the dead.&quot; Here he begins to push the dichotomy of living vs dead, lit vs dark, paralyzed vs mobile, etc. –- one's perception of the life of the Church is shaped by his inner condition. &quot;But unclouded eyes see as always the faces of the saints as radiant, 'as the faces of angels.' For a purified heart, these faces are, as always, inviting ... they cry out to those who have ears to hear.&quot; Emphases on &quot;unclouded eyes,&quot; &quot;purified heart,&quot; etc., all conditions necessary to see &quot;the dogmas&quot; as something living and radiant rather than frozen and rigid.<p>Who has such qualities? Florensky seems to suggest they are most effortlessly present in &quot;common folk&quot;, asking, &quot;Why are the common folk ... involuntarily drawn to these saints?&quot;<h3>III.</h3><p>&quot;I do not delude myself. I firmly know that I have done no more than light a penny candle of yellow wax.&quot; Here I think Florensky is referring to his work as a whole; it's hard for us to imagine anyone of his brilliance expressing genuine intellectual and spiritual humility -- and a little later he quotes Simon Azar'in: &quot;I know my own poverty and both my conscience and my vice-stained mind fill me with remorse...&quot; -- yet the comparison is between himself and the &quot;treasure-house of the Holy Church.&quot; Illumined by this treasure-house, &quot;even this little flame, trembling [his] unaccustomed hands, has brought forth a myriad of sparkling reflections...&quot; Indeed he refers to the history of the Church over the centuries, graced by the lives of &quot;God-illuminated souls,&quot; collected within herself.<p>Florensky gives beautiful descriptions here: &quot;The most secret yearnings, the most concealed aspirations to God-likening; the azure moments of angelic purity that come after the storm; the joys of communion with God and the holy torments of ardent repentance,&quot; etc., etc., abiding and growing through the ages. For him, &quot;every one of [his] spiritual efforts ... summons the entire store of accumulated gracious energy to my aid.&quot;<p>He express his feeling of &quot;grabbing&quot; for the riches of the Church, without knowing precisely what he has grasped: &quot;I do not know if my handful is better or worse than all that remains.&quot; Hence, he is all too aware of his smallness before the accumulated wealth of e Church: &quot;I know that I am dissatisfied in advance by my work, because my eyes burn too gredily at the sight of these treasures.&quot;<h3>IV.</h3><p>Florensky admits: &quot;At first my intention was to use no references, only my own words&quot; – but soon enough, &quot;it appeared that I had to discard everything of my own and publish only the works of the Church.&quot; Once again, then, we can expect that this is a book about the Church; and thought it is quite in Florensky's own words, he implies that he adds nothing that ultimately does not come from the Church. &quot;Perhaps that is the only right way, the way that consists in directly addressing the Church itself&quot; – again, a claim to exclusivity. What other ways might there be?<p>This early, it strikes us that there is a certain contradiction here, perhaps one that we can expect to pervade the work: on the one hand, Florensky's sponteneity, and on the other hand, the &quot;constraints&quot; of the Church. Yet the constraints precisely give him a sense of freedom. From what? The self, the ego. &quot;Who am I to write about what is holy?&quot; By recognizing these constraints, he frees his own insights.<p>At this point the chapter may be said to come to a head here, where Florensky reveals his purpose: &quot;But if I nevertheless do attribute some significance to my Letters, it is an exclusively preparatory one, for catechumens. These letters are intended to provide some sustenance for them until they are able to receive nourishment directly from their Mother's hand.&quot;<h2>Ecclesiality</h2><h3>V.</h3><p>From here, Florensky turns toward a discussion of ecclesiality. From the Church itself and her storehouses, to the <em>quality</em> of being Church, whatever that means: &quot;the name of the refuge where the heart's anxiety finds peace, where the pretensions of the rational mind are tamed, where great tranquility descends into our reason.&quot; He seems to suggest that these and more describe the church due to a particular quality: yet he does not define precisely what this quality is. &quot;Let those who attempt such a definition dispute one another and mutually refute one another's formulas...&quot; Indeed, he argues that its very indefinability in logical terms prove that ecclesiality is itself &quot;life, a special, new life&quot; -- given, but inaccessible to the rational mind? Florensky sees this as confirmation of St Paul's words in Eph. 1:23: &quot;the fullness of him that filleth all in all.&quot; Therefore, it cannot be contained within a logical definition.<p>Yet he claims that its illogicity is not ridiculous; that it does not disprove the existence of ecclesiality. On the contrary, the opposite is true. And despite divergences in opinion, he claims that anybody within the Church who participates in its life &quot;receives into himself by his very life the unitary element of ecclesiality and knows that ecclesiality is and what it is.&quot; Here he seems to parallel the divine name: as God is, so is ecclesiality. He also sees it as a &quot;unitary element&quot; – a quality that unites.<h3>VI.</h3><p>Unsprisingly at this point he makes comparisons among the differing concepts of ecclesiality in the Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant churches, asserting that &quot;Where there is no spiritual life, something external must exist as an assurance of ecclesiality.&quot; For the Catholics, it is the papacy. For the Protestants, specific formulas, systems of formulas, or the text of Scripture itself. (Interesting that he says &quot;the text of Scripture&quot; rather than Scripture itself, indicating the Protestant treatment of Scripture outside its traditional context). Florensky summarizes these differences: &quot;what is decisive is a concept&quot; -- for the Catholics, an ecclesiastical-juridical one, and for the Protestants an eclessiastical-scientific one. He argues that to either of these Christian bodies, its respective concept itself of eclessiality renders &quot;manifestation of life&quot; unnecessary. In short, a clear, definable concept of eclessiality – what makes Church church? – does not necessarily lead to spiritual life. If the Church is church, in the final analysis, owing to its particular heirarchy or formulas, then all is said and done; it stops there.<p>Rather, Florensky tries to bring our attention to <em>independent</em> manifestations of life. Were they to be constrained by clearly and logically defined concepts, the Catholic mind would render it <em>noncanonical</em>, the Protestant one <em>unscientific</em>. &quot;In both cases, life is truncated by a concept; it is rejected in advance in the name of a concept.&quot;<p>Indeed, he asserts that is incorrect to compare the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches with regard to their acceptance of freedom: namely, that Catholicism rejects it while Protestantism accepts it. Rather, that Catholicism recognizes a freedom that is defined beforehand (canonical); and that Protestantism recognizes &quot;compulsion&quot; only outside (is this a mistake? Does he mean within?) the predefined bounds of rationalism. &quot;If in Catholicism one can perceive the fanaticism of canonicity, then in Protestantism one can perceive the equally great fanaticism of scientism.&quot; Note here the word &quot;perceive&quot; -- that to see these things requires a certain level of perception.<h3>VII.</h3><p>Once again, &quot;The indefinability of Orthodox ecclesiality ... is the best proof of its vitality.&quot; In other words, one &quot;cannot point to any one ecclesial function about which it can be said that it sums up all of ecclesiality&quot; -- otherwise, what is the point of anything else in the Church's functions and activities? Neither is any one formula or book a summation of the fullness of ecclesial life. Indeed there is no concept, but the is-ness of ecclessiality itself. This is known only through life, not in the abstract nor in a rational way.<p>Here Florensky, once again, comes to a head: &quot;If one must nevertheless apply concepts to the life of the Church, the most appropriate concepts would be not juridical and archaeological ones but biological and aesthetic ones. What is ecclesiality? It is a new life, life in the Spirit. What is the criterion of the rightness of this life? Beauty.&quot; This is quite a deliberate answer, as he goes on to say, it is &quot;the only true path to the definition of what is orthodox and what is not orthodox.&quot; Important to note here that he offers not a decisive answer, yet points clearly to a &quot;path&quot; to it, which is beauty.<h3>VIII.</h3><p>And here Florensky resists offering a definition of beauty, but rather points us to its connoisseurs: the spiritual elders, the startsy, the &quot;masters of the 'art of arts,'&quot; which is asceticism. By their perception of beauty, they see into the quality of spiritual life. This is not calculated, but felt. Florensky gives us here as strong idea of the Orthodox temperament; the elusive nature of Orthodoxy, which makes it understandable through only one way: direct experience, through ascetic effort.<p>&quot;One can become a Catholic or a Protestant without experiencing life at all&quot; -- and here he means spiritual life -- &quot;by reading books in one's study.&quot; But to become Orthodox, there is no other way but to begin to live in an Orthodox way. Indeed, the surface harshness of his assessments of Catholicism and Protestantism might be off-putting in today's climate, yet perhaps we can turn it around to say that by transcending the investigation of the ecclesial beyond what can be read in books, or argued logically, one indeed becomes Orthodox, connecting oneself to a living body.<div>←<a href="../">Go back</a></div></main>
