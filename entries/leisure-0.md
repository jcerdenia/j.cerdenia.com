From chapter 1 of _Leisure, the Basis of Culture_

## Summary 

1. We live today in a world of "total work".
2. The original meaning of "leisure" has been forgotten.
3. Modern claims made of "work" and the "worker" betray an altered conception of the human being as such, compared to ancient and medieval thought.

## Work and Leisure

### Why leisure?

Pieper begins with an objection (the context of which was the years following World War II, yet is just as applicable today): "We are engaged in the re-building of a hosue, and our hands are full. Shouldn't all our efforts be directed to nothing other than the completion of that house?"

To which he responds: "To 'build our house' at this time implies not only securing survival, but also putting in order again our entire moral and intellectual heritage. And before any detailed plan along these lines can succeed, a new beginning, our re-foundation, calls out immediately for ... a defense of leisure."

### The claims of the world of total work

From the outset we assume that we live today in a world of "total work" -- work as the prime human activity, an end in itself. "Leisure," as popularly understood, stands in contrast to work; yet the original meaning of this word has been forgotten. After all the Greek word for leisure is the origin of the _scola_, _Schule_, and _school_. Leisure is one of the foundations of Western European culture.

Pieper writes: " ... our inability to recover the original meaning of 'leisure', will stike us all the more when we realize how extensively the opposing idea of 'work' has invaded and taken over the whole realm of human action and of human existence as a whole; when we realize, as well, how ready we are to grant all claims made for the person who 'works'."

He goes on: "An altered conception of the human being _as such_, and a new interpretation of the meaning of human existence _as such_, looms behind the new claims being made for 'work' and the 'worker'."

Note that by "worker," Pieper uses the word in an anthropological sense: a "general human ideal," not in the sociological sense of the "proletarian worker."
