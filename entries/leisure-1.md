title: "Historical antecedents to the concept of `intellectual work` according to Josef Pieper"
---

From chapter 2 of _Leisure, the Basis of Culture_

## Summary

In this chapter Pieper locates the "modern ideal of work in its most extreme formulation" around the concept of "intellectual work." He sketches out 3 historical antecedents of the concept:

1. The tension between _ratio_ and _intellectus_ with regard to the act of knowing: the former being active and discursive, the latter having to do with "vision." The modern assumption is that knowing only comes through _ratio_.

2. The idea that effort is the criterion of truth (or what determines the value of an act).

3. A particular social doctrine that equates work with social utility.

## Intellectual work

Piper notes that the the notion of the intellectual enterprise as work is an extreme expression of the modern ideal of work: in contrast, in the past it "tended to be looked upon as a kind of paradise, where nobody needed to work." _Philosophy_ was removed from the working world.

He gives 3 historical antecedents to the concept of intellectual work.

### 1. _Ratio_ and _intellectus_

#### The act of knowing as work

Intellectual work is based on a particular interpration of the act of knowing. Pieper asks, is there something such as "intellectual vision" with regard to encountering things that are imperceptible to the senses? Vision here suggests effortlessness, effortless as merely looking at an object and knowing what it is. To the ancients and medievals, yes, there is; to moderns, not really.

Kant is a prime example: to him, knowing is exclusively "discursive," not "merely looking." In this view, "human knowing consists essentially in the act of investigating, articulating, joining, comparing, distinguishing, abstracting, deducing, proving – all of which are so many types and methods of active mental effort." In short, human knowing is nothing but activity; hence philosophy a form of work.

#### Intellective vision

But premodern philosophy had an opposite view. The Greeks and the great medieval thinkers "all held that there was an element of purely receptive 'looking,' not only in the sense of perception but also in intellectual knowing or, as Heraclitus said, '_Listening-in to the being of things_'."

The medievals distinguished between _ratio_ and _intellectus_: the former is discursive thought (from the Latin _dis-currere_, "to run to and fro"), while the latter "simply looking" (_simplex intuitus_), "to which the truth presents itself as a landscape presents itself to the eye" -- note that it does not mean passive, but _receptive_. To them, the intellect involves both ways.

Another distinction: _ratio_ as the human element of human knowing, and _intellectus_ as "super-human," or having something to do with the divine. "For it is essential to the human person to reach beyond ... into the order of angels, the truly intellectual beings." Aquinas says as much: "Although human knowing really takes place in the mode of _ratio_, nevertheless it is a kind of participation in that simple knowing which takes place in higher natures, and we can thus conclude that human beings possess a power of intellectual vision" (_Disputed Questions on Truth_).

Pieper goes on: "But the simple act of the _intellectus_ is not work ... whoever, finally, can retain in philosophy an element of contemplation of being as a whole ... will have to grant that a characterization of knowing and philosophy as 'work' is not only not exhaustive, but does not even reach the core of the matter ..." In short, "there is something else in it, something essential to it, that is _not_ work."

And here is the crux of the matter: that if knowing is exclusively work, the one who knows grasps nothing but the result of his own labor, which is subjective. "There is nothing in his knowing that is not the fruit of his own efforts; there is nothing 'received' in it." Furthermore, "the hard quality of _not-being-able-to-receive_; a stoniness of heart, that will not brook any resistance – as expressed once, most radically, the following terrifying statement: 'Every action makes sense, even criminal acts ... all passivity is senseless.'" (Rauschning, _Conversations with Hitler_)

### 2. Effort

#### Effort as the criterion of truth

Kant saw a legitimization of philosophy in the effort involved in it: "philosophy is genuine, _insofar_ as it is a 'Herculean labor'." He expected no knowledge in intellectual vision, precisely because it is effortless. Pieper notes that this is peculiar criterion for determining the value of action, something that looms behind our modern attitude to work. In short, that "the truth of what is known is determined by the effort put into knowing it." -- even shorter still, that the Good is difficult.

Antisthenes, a Cynic, said as much long ago. Pieper writes that he represented the first paradigm of the worker, not only equating effort with goodness but extolling "Hercules as the Accomplisher of Superhuman Actions." He was a "surpisingly modern" thinker. Indeed there is something in him, as Pieper describes, of the familiar traits of the modern "workaholic": "[Antisthenes] had no feeling for cultic celebration ... no responsiveness to Eros ... no belief in immortality (what really matters ... was to live rightly 'on this earth')." I would note as well the similarity with the modern evangelical Protestant ethos - to varying degrees, no liturgy, no cycles of fasting and feasting, a marked emphasis on the spiritual world at the expense of the physical; no wonder at all about the "Protestant work ethic.""

#### Aquinas' objection

But Aquinas objects: "The essence of virtue consists more in the Good than in the Difficult." He says, as paraphrased by Pieper, that "virtue perfects us so that we can _follow_ our natural inclination in the right way ... they take place _effortlessly_ because it is of their essence to arise from love." Contrast this to the Kantian (and familiarly modern) view that virtue is about mastering our natural (immoral) inclinations.

Therefore, "the essence of knowing would lie, not in the effort of thought as such, but in the grasp of the being of things, in the discovery of reality." Furthermore, "Thomas speaks of _contemplation_ and _play_ in a single breath." (See Wisdom 8:30.) Knowing means "reaching" the reality of things; not the effort of thought.

Why then the overepmhasis on effort? "... man distrusts everything that is without effort ... he refuses to let himself be given anything." Consider the stark contrast to the Christian understanding of "grace."

### 3. Utility

#### Work as contribution to society

The third element, to Pieper, that is behind the concept of "intellectual work" is the social doctrine that understands work as "contribution to the common utility" – a social service. Furthermore, it usually includes reference to the "working class," so as to imply that not only the prolateriat are workers, even the learned and students. In short, the intelelctual worker "too is a functionary in the total world of work" -- a specialist. Hence, "nobody ... is granted a 'free zone' of intellectual activity, 'free' meaning _not_ being subordinated to a duty to fulfill some function." Hence, this is a view of work that essentializes it to always include some kind of social function.

#### Are there such things as liberal arts?

Pieper goes back to the "old question" about the justification of the liberal arts. Summoning Aquinas again, "Every art is called _liberal_ which is ordered to knowing; those which are ordered to some utility to be attained through action are called _servile_ arts." Therefore, the liberal arts have justification in themselves, while servile arts have an external purpose.

Yet Pieper writes, "this is not to say anything against professional training ... of course, the vocationally specialized exercise a function of a function is the normal form of human activity." But, "can the world of man be exhausted in being 'the working world'?" Or, "are there such things as liberal arts? The architects of the total world of work would have to answer, 'No'."

On the contrary, the ancients affirm the existence of "non-useful" forms of activity (liberal arts), without thinking in the extreme that not everything that might be said to not be "useful" is indeed useless. (Here the idea of the "true, good, and beautiful" come to mind strongly -- which is what must be recovered in the idea of leisure.)
