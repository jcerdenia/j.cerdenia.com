- Living/melting in the Philippines since 2020. I moved back here to reboot after several years of “the artist life” in New York. The move ended up coinciding with the pandemic. I've enjoyed not having to deal with any country's immigration system these last two years, but now I'm planning a move to Europe.

- Working as a full-stack developer with [FireVisor](https://firevisor.com), building AI-powered web applications and analytic tools to help solar manufacturers make better use of data.

- I'm not seriously working on any new music right now, though my work continues to be performed in random corners of the world, for which I manage purchases and rentals.

- Building this site, working on various small coding projects, and learning everything there is to learn.
