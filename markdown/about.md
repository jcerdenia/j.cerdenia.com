This site is meant for anything I'm personally interested in: code, music, and everything in between.

Right now, I work as a software engineer. Before that, I worked as a composer, performer, and arts administrator; now I treat music as a serious hobby (it's better that way). I draw on my musical experience and sensibilities to bring a unique perspective to my work.

I was born and raised in the Philippines and have spent seasons in Singapore, Baltimore, and New York City. Currently I live in the Metro Manila area.

# Technical

This is nothing but a static site built with a custom Node.js-based [static site generator](https://github.com/joshuacerdenia/garden.cerdenia.com). There are no frameworks other than Express.js to serve the site in development, and Bootstrap CSS, which I may get rid of eventually.
