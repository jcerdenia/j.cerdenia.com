This site is meant for anything I'm personally interested in.

Profesionally, I work as a full-stack developer specializing in JavaScript frameworks. Previously I worked as a composer, performer, and arts administrator; now I treat music as a serious hobby. I draw on my music experience to bring a unique perspective to my work.

I was born and raised in the Philippines and have spent seasons in Singapore, Baltimore, and New York City.

# About this site / Technical

This is nothing but a static site built with my own [static site generator](https://github.com/joshuacerdenia/garden.cerdenia.com). No frameworks other than Bootstrap CSS, and Express.js to serve the site in development.
