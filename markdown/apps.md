title: "Some Apps I've Built"
draft: true
---

Various side projects done on my own time and from scratch, with or without collaborators, and of varying degrees of doneness - enough to all be considered shipped, though not necessarily maintained.

Some of these were written early into my first forays in modern app development and don't necessarily reflect my current ability. At this time they skew heavily toward Android apps, though at present, I'm more interested in developing for the web.
