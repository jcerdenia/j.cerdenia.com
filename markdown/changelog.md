No real changes on the front end, but I've been figuring out a development experience that makes sense to me. I have ended up with a poor man's static site generator, which was not my original intent, but makes updating the site pleasant. In development, a simple server builds each page on demand. Previously, I would run a build script for the whole site before pushing to to the [remote repo](https://github.com/joshuacerdenia/cerdenia.com), but now I let Vercel handle it in deployment.

And we're live. Reverted to a much simpler layout. Got rid of the blog; I don't really want to keep one. My [dev](https://dev.cerdenia.com) and [music](https://music.cerdenia.comn) sites are now kept separate under their own subdomains. As for this main domain, I'll figure out what to do with it as I go.
