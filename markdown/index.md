<small>My current surroundings</small>

Hi, I'm Joshua. I lead a double life as a [software developer](https://github.com/joshuacerdenia) and [composer](https://music.cerdenia.com). This is my personal site. There's not much to see right now, but I'm working on it.

I'm experimenting with a private [newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/jcletters) to share irregular updates on life and music on a personal scale. Join to make contact and exchange thoughts.

Were you looking for my music? All that is [here](https://cerdenia.com).
