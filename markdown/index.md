Hi, I'm Joshua. I lead a double life as a [software developer](https://github.com/joshuacerdenia) and [composer/musician](https://music.cerdenia.com). This is my  attempt at a personal [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/).

I'm experimenting with a private [newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/jcletters) to share irregular updates on life and music on a personal scale. Join to make contact and exchange thoughts.
