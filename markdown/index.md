Hi, I'm Joshua. I lead a double life as a software developer and composer/musician.

Check out [my music](https://music.cerdenia.com) or [coding projects](https://dev.cerdenia.com).

I'm experimenting with a private [newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/jcletters) to share irregular updates on life and music on a personal scale. Join to make contact and exchange thoughts.
