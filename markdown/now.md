In the style of [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about)

- Living/melting in the Philippines. I moved back here in 2020 to reboot after several years of “the artist life” in NYC. It ended up coinciding with the pandemic. I don't plan on being here forever, but where I'll go next is anyone's guess.

- Laboring in obscurity as a software engineer and learning everything there is to learn.

- Handling purchases and rentals of [my music](https://music.cerdenia.com/news), which continues to be heard in random parts of the world. Otherwise, I'm not doing any serious composing right now.
