title: "What I'm Doing Now"
---

In the style of [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about)

- Living/melting in the Philippines since 2020. I moved back here to reboot after several years of “the artist life” in NYC. It ended up coinciding with the pandemic. I've enjoyed not having to deal with any country's immigration system since then, but now I'm planning my next move within the year.

- Working remotely as a full-stack developer with a small startup and looking out for my next role.

- I'm not doing any serious composing right now, though [my work continues to be performed](https://music.cerdenia.com/news) in random corners of the world, for which I manage purchases and rentals.

- Maintaining my sites, working on side projects, and learning everything there is to learn.
