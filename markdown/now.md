In the style of [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about)

- Living/melting in the Philippines. I moved back here in 2020 to [reboot](/2020) after several years of “the artist life” in NYC. It ended up coinciding with the pandemic. I don't plan on being here forever, but where I'll go next is anyone's guess.

- Laboring in obscurity as a software engineer at a fintech company.

- I'm taking a break from composing, but [my music](https://music.cerdenia.com/news) continues to be played in random parts of the world, for which I handle purchases and rentals. I'm open occasionally to small music projects.
